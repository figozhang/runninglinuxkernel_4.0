title: Trace slow file system synchronous reads and writes (non-debuginfo)
name: fsslower-nd.stp
author: Brendan Gregg
keywords: io filesystem
description: This dynamically traces two common file system functions: do_sync_read() and do_sync_write(), and shows details of each call that is slower than a threshold. Many, but not all, file systems and workloads use these functions. Tracing their time provides one view of suffered file system latency.
scope: system-wide
usage: ./fsslower-nd.stp [min_ms]
arg_1: Minimum millisecond threshold
