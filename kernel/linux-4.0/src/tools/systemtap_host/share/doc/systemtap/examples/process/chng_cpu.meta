description: The chng_cpu.stp script takes an argument which is the executable name of the task it should monitor. Each time a task with that executable name is found running on a different processor, the script prints out the thread id (tid), the executable name, the processor now running the task, the thread state, and a backtrace showing the kernel functions that triggered the running of the task on the processor.
arg_1: The name of the executable to monitor
test_check: stap -p4 chng_cpu.stp bash
test_installcheck: stap chng_cpu.stp -c "sleep 1" bash
