title: pthread mutex contention analysis
name: mutex-contention.stp
keywords: locking
description: Tracks pthread-mutex initialization/use and underlying futex operations, to identify (with backtraces/symbol-names) the mutexes suffering most contention.  Invoke with "-d SHLIB --ldd", perhaps with -DMAXMAPENTRIES=NNNN for some large NNNN, if the arrays overflow due to heavy activity.
