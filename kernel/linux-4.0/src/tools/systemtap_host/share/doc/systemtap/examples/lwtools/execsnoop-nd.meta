title: Trace process exec() with command line argument details (non-debuginfo)
name: execsnoop-nd.stp
author: Brendan Gregg
keywords: io
description: This can identify if CPU is consumed by short-lived processes, by tracing new process execution. It works by tracing exec() from the fork()->exec() sequence, which means it will not catch new processes that only fork(). It will also show every exec(), including those if a process re-execs.
