title: Count I/O Syscalls using Alias Suffixes
name: alias_suffixes.stp
keywords: io statistics
subsystem: io
status: experimental
exit: user-controlled
output: on-exit
scope: system-wide
description: alias_suffixes.stp is a demonstration of how alias suffixes in the systemtap language might be used. The script tracks the wall clock time for each invocation of the system calls open, close, read, and write. When the script exists it prints out the minimum, average, and maximum times in microseconds for each system call, followed by a count of times that each syscall was invoked and a histogram showing the distributions of times.
