netfilter_summary.stp - System-Wide Count of Network Packets by IPs

  The script watches all IPv4 network traffic on the system. On exit
  the script prints a list showing the number of packets sent along
  source IP address / destination IP address pair encountered, and the
  total number of bytes sent among the pair. The list is ordered from
  greatest to least number of packets seen among the source/destination
  pairs.

The output above was from when the system was doing nothing interesting.

Heavily used connections will rise to the top of the list.

The script's output gives a basic understanding of where packets are
being sent to and received from. Other scripts can be used to supplement
the gathered information.
