description: The script watches each wait4 syscall on the system. At the end of each wait4 syscall the script prints out a line with a timestamp in microseconds, the pid, the executable name in parentheses, the "wait4:" key, the duration of the wait and the PID that the wait4 was waiting for. If the waited for PID is not specified , it is "-1".
