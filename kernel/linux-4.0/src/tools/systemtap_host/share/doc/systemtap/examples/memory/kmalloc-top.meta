description: The kmalloc-top perl program runs a small systemtap script to collect stack traces for each call to the kmalloc function and counts the time that each stack trace is observed. When kmalloc-top exits it prints out sorted list. The output can be filtered to print only the first N stack traces (-t), stack traces with a minimum counts (-m), or exclude certain stack traces (-e).
