Example using LTTng TMF Eclipse Plugin with Example SystemTap Script proc_snoop.stp

1. Installing the Plugin
	- Follow instructions given below to setup and run the LTTng parsing library 
	and TMF eclipse plugin:
		- Parsing library: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/LTTng
		- TMF eclipse plugin: http://lttng.org/eclipse


2. Importing the Parser
	- Once you have it up and running in eclipse, open the LTTng perspective. 
		- Window > Open Perspective > Other... > LTTng

	- Open the TMF/Projects view. 
		- Window > Show View > Other... > TMF > Projects

	- Open Manage Custom Parsers page
		- Click the downward pointing arrow in the top right corner of the 
		TMF/Projects view. 

	- Import the proc_snoop_parser.xml parser from:
		systemtap/testsuite/systemtap.examples/process/proc_snoop_parser.xml


3. Running the Script
	- Create a folder somewhere to store the tracefile.
		- e.g. $ mkdir ~/Desktop/tracefile

	- Run the proc_snoop.stp script and pipe the output to a file in the above 
	folder. Let it run for a few seconds so you get a number of lines of output, 
	then stop it with ctrl-c. Look in the file and make sure there are less than 
	50,000 lines before continuing. If there are more (or none) run the script 
	again, adjusting the running time accordingly. 

	$ stap systemtap/testsuite/systemtap.examples/
	process/proc_snoop.stp > ~/Desktop/tracefile/tracefile.txt


4. Parsing the File
	- In the TMF/Projects view, right click and choose "Import Trace".
	- Right click again, and choose "New Experiment". Name it and click "OK".
	- Right click on the new experiment and choose "Select Traces". Choose 
	tracefile.txt.
	- In the new experiment, right click on tracefile.txt and choose 
		- Select Parser > Custom > Proc_Snoop_Parser
	- Double Click on the tracefile to parse it. It will show up in a neatly 
	parsed list.

	NOTE: Due to the limitations of the custom text parser, the views
	that use timestamp information will not function properly with this
	script. Currently, to be able to use those views, timestamps must be in
	the form of the SimpleDateFormat class- they cannot be just a large, 
	increasing number such as 43928472.
