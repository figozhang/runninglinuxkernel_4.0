keywords: io statistics

  alias_suffixes.stp is a demonstration of how alias suffixes in the
  systemtap language might be used. The script tracks the wall clock
  time for each invocation of the system calls open, close, read, and
  write. When the script exists it prints out the minimum, average, and
  maximum times in microseconds for each system call, followed by a
  count of times that each syscall was invoked and a histogram showing
  the distributions of times.

general/para-callgraph-verbose.stp - Callgraph Tracing with Verbose Arguments
keywords: trace callgraph

  Print a timed per-thread microsecond-timed callgraph, complete with
  pretty-printed function parameters and return values.  The first
  parameter names the function probe points to trace.  The optional

general/stopwatches.stp - See the amount of wall clock time a process spends in various states
keywords: time

  The stopwatch.stp script illustrates how to use multiple stopwatches
  record how much wallclock time a process spends in kernel- and
  user-space.  On exit the script prints out the time in seconds,
  milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. Note that this output of
  this script is not directly comparable to the time command because
  time records the time that the process is actually active in kernel-
  and user-space.

general/varwatch.stp - Watch a Variable Changing Value in a Thread
keywords: _best monitoring

  This script places a set of probes (specified by $1), each of which
  monitors the state of some context $variable expression (specified by
  $2).	Whenever the value changes, with respect to the active thread,
  the event is traced.

  # stap -w varwatch.stp 'kernel.statement("do_sys_open@fs/open.c:*")' \
  '$$vars' -c "sleep 1"


general/watchdog.stp - Watchdog Timer for Arbitrary Events
keywords: watchdog backtrace

  The watchdog.stp script provides a watchdog timer mechanism for
  arbitrary events. The script takes three arguments: the events to
  start watchdog timer, the event to stop the watchdog timer, and the
  time in millseconds for the watchdog. If the watchdog timer is
  exceed, the script will trigger a stack backtrace of the user-process
  that timed out using pstack. This script can be used to diagnose what
  the userspace application is doing when a slower than expected
  operation occurs.

  # stap watchdog.stp 'syscall.nanosleep' 'syscall.nanosleep.return' 1000 \
  -c "sleep 1"


general/whythefail.stp - Why did the function fail?
keywords: speculation monitoring function trace _best

  The whythefail.stp script prints a statement-execution trace for a
  given function, but only for those runs of the function that ended up
  with a (configurable) post-return condition.

  # stap whythefail.stp kernel sys_open '$return < 0' -c 'cat \
  /root/no-such-file || true'


interrupt/interrupts-by-dev.stp - Record Interrupts on a Per-Device Basis

keywords: interrupt backtrace

  The Linux kernel function smp_call_function causes expensive
  inter-processor interrupts (IPIs). The scf.stp script tallies the
  processes and backtraces causing the interprocessor interrupts to
  identify the cause of the expensive IPI. On exit the script prints
  the tallies in descending frequency.

  # stap scf.stp -c "sleep 1"


io/deviceseeks.stp - Histograms of Seek Behavior for Each Device

io/ioblktime.stp - Average Time Block IO Requests Spend in Queue 
keywords: io

  The ioblktime.stp script tracks the amount of time that each block IO

  average waiting time for block IO per device and prints list every 10
  seconds. In some cases there can be too many outstanding block IO
  operations and the script may exceed the default number of
  MAXMAPENTRIES allowed. In this case the allowed number can be
  increased with "-DMAXMAPENTRIES=10000" option on the stap command
  line.

  # stap ioblktime.stp -c "sleep 1"

  The script watches each open, close, read, and write syscalls on the
  system. For each file the scripts observes opened it accumulates the
  amount of wall clock time spent in read and write operations and the
  number of bytes read and written. When a file is closed the script
  prints out a pair of lines for the file. Both lines begin with a
  timestamp in microseconds, the PID number, and the executable name in
  parentheses. The first line with the "access" keyword lists the file
  name, the attempted number of bytes for the read and write
  operations. The second line with the "iotime" keyword list the file
  name and the number of microseconds accumulated in the read and write
  syscalls.

  activity on the system, printing a scrolling record of recent
  keystrokes, on a per-tty basis.

  # stap --skip-badvars -g ttyspy.stp -c "sleep 1"


locks/bkl.stp - Tracing Contention on Big Kernel Lock
keywords: locking

  The bkl.stp script can help determine whether the Big Kernel Lock
  (BKL) is causing serialization on a multiprocessor system due to
  excessive contention of the BKL. The bkl.stp script takes two
  arguments. The first one is optional, and used to enable backtraces,
  and print them once a process has been holding the BKL for a user
  specified number of nseconds is reached. The second option is
  compulsory and is the number of processes waiting for the Big Kernel
  Lock (BKL). When the number of processes waiting for the BKL is
  reached or exceeded, the script will print a time stamp, the number
  of processes waiting for the BKL, the holder of the BKL, and the
  amount of time the BKL was held. If backtraces are enabled, a
  backtrace will be printed as well.

  # stap bkl.stp -c "sleep 1" 1


locks/bkl_stats.stp - Per Process Statistics on Big Kernel Lock Use
keywords: locking

  The bkl_stats.stp script can indicate which processes have excessive
  waits for the Big Kernel Lock (BKL) and which processes are taking
  the BKL for long periods of time. The bkl_stats.stp script prints
  lists of all the processes that require the BKL. Every five seconds
  two tables are printed out. The first table lists the processes that
  waited for the BKL followed by the number of times that the process
  waited, the minimum time of the wait, the average and the maximum
  time waited. The second table lists has similar information for the
  time spent in holding the lock for each of the processes.

keywords: memory

  The mmanonpage.stp script uses the virtual memory tracepoints
  available in some kernels to track the number of faults, user space
  frees, page ins, copy on writes and unmaps for anonymous pages. When
  the script is terminated the counts are printed for each process that
  allocated pages while the script was running. This script displays
  the anonymous page statistics for each process that ran while the

  a supposedly idle system that is experiencing unexpected IO.

  # stap mmwriteback.stp -c "sleep 1"


memory/numa_faults.stp - Summarize Process Misses across NUMA Nodes
keywords: memory numa

  The numa_faults.stp script tracks the read and write pages faults for
  each process. When the script exits it prints out the total read and

keywords: memory

  The pfaults.stp script generates a simple log for each major and
  minor page fault that occurs on the system. Each line contains a
  timestamp (in microseconds) when the page fault servicing was
  completed, the pid of the process, the address of the page fault, the
  type of access (read or write), the type of fault (major or minor),
  and the elapsed time for page fault. This log can be examined to
  determine where the page faults are occurring.

  # stap pfaults.stp -c "sleep 1"


memory/vm.tracepoints.stp - Collect Slab Allocation Statistics
keywords: memory statistics

  The script will probe all memory slab/slub allocations and collects
  information about the size of the object (bytes requested) and

virtualization/kvm_service_time.stp - Time Statistics on KVM Exit Reasons
keywords: _best virtualization kvm

  The kvm_service_time.stp script tracks the statistics about the
  amount of time that the processor left the guest virtual machine for

  IO operation).  When the script exits it prints out the number of
  times each exit reason was encountered, the total duration of time it
  left the guest VM, the minimum time, the average time, and the
  maximum time in microseconds for that exit reason. On Linux 2.6.38
  and newer kernel the script can automatically determine whether it is
  running on Intel or AMD processors. For older kernels with a
  kernel.trace("kvm_exit") tracepoint that does not have the $isa
  parameter you can explicitly state the kvm type with a "-G kvm=intel"
  or "-G kvm=amd" on the command line.
