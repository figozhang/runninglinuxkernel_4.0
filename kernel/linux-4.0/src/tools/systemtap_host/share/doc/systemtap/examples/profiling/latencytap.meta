description: The latencytap.stp script collects data on the intervals processes are deactivated (sleeping).  The script categorizes the reasons for the sleeps by analyzing the backtraces and displays a sorted list of the top 20 causes from largest total sum time sleeping to smallest. The output is updated every 30 seconds. The script needs to be compiled with the '--all-modules' option to produce reasons for sleeps caused by modules.  Optionally, this script can be used with the '-c' or '-x' options to focus on a specific PID.
