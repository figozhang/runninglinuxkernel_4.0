 * sfunction tz_ctime - Convert seconds since epoch into human readable date/time string, with local time zone
 *
 * @epochsecs: number of seconds since epoch (as returned by gettimeofday_s())
 *
 * Description: Takes an argument of seconds since the epoch as returned by
 * gettimeofday_s().  Returns a string of the same form as ctime(), but
 * offsets the epoch time for the local time zone, and appends the name of the
 * local time zone.  The string length may vary.  The time zone information is
 * passed by staprun at script startup only.
